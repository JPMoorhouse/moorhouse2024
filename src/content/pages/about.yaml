      title: The Moorhouse Story
      description: >
        Founded in 1997,&nbsp; Moorhouse Coating started as a small-town
        painting contractor in Summit County, Utah. From the beginning,
        Moorhouse took on large painting projects while maintaining the personal
        touch of a small company. With just a single trailer and crew, we
        tackled the complex challenges of painting and coating properties in a
        resort community. With a vision of making residential and commercial
        painting services easier and more convenient for property owners and
        commercial managers.
