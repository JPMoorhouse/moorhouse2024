            The cost to paint an average to oversized office (12x14) is
            approximately $240 to $375. Typically the ceiling doesnâ€™t require
            painting so the wall dimensions given a 9.5 foot tall ceiling is

            Painters' price range for labor cost varies widely!  Depending on
            the season, location, height, skill and overall experience
            necessary, affect the hourly rate.  Low skilled paint projects will
            sell for $40.00 per hour upto highly experienced professionally
            trained $90.00 per hour.  Average rates hover around $50.00 per hour
            in most cities.

            The average cost to paint the interior of a house falls between
            $2.00 and 3.00 per square foot if the house has been previously
            painted.  A new home will cost between $3.00 and $6.00 per square
            feet depending on the preparation required.  A new custom home cost
            between $6.00 and $12.00 per square feet.
        - title: Average cost of painting a house
          answer: >-
            The average cost to paint the outside of a 2200 square foot house is
            $5000.00 If the perimeter is 30 x 40, roughly  30+30+40+40 = 140
            linear feet * 16 = 2240 Square feet.  The average cost per square
            foot is roughly $1.50 to $3.00 a square foot.  So, 2240 sq ft *
            $2.25 is roughly $5,000.00 to paint an existing home exterior.
        - title: How to find house painters near me?
          answer: >-
            Hands down, ask the local paint center for three professional
            painters.  They know who buys the best paint and has reasonable
            prices.  Check with your local Sherwin Williams, PPG, Dunn Edwards
            or Benjamin Moore retail paint center.
