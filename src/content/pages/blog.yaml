            The average cost to paint the outside of a 2200 square foot house is
            $5000.00 If the perimeter is 30 x 40, roughly  30+30+40+40 = 140

            foot is roughly $1.50 to $3.00 a square foot.  So, 2240 sq ft *

            Hands down, ask the local paint center for three professional
            painters.  They know who buys the best paint and has reasonable
            prices.  Check with your local Sherwin Williams, PPG, Dunn Edwards
            or Benjamin Moore retail paint center.
