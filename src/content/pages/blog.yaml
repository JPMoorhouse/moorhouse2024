        Keeping up with a maintenance painting schedule with Moorhouse Coating
        is like giving your property a mini makeover all year round—with none of
        the reality show drama but all the "wow" factor. Here's why it's a
        no-brainer:


        1. **Make It Last, Like Fine Wine (or Fine Vinyl)**: Regular painting is
        like SPF for your building! It protects those surfaces from the everyday
        wear and tear, rain, sun, and whatever else Mother Nature decides to
        throw at us. Skip the maintenance, and suddenly you’re hosting a peeling
        paint party—but trust us, no one wants to attend that.

        1. **Stealthy Savings During Off-Season**: You know that satisfaction of
        snagging an item on sale? That's what our off-season rates feel like! By
        scheduling during our less busy months, you’re saving those precious
        pennies without cutting corners. It’s like finding a secret stash of
        cash in your winter coat… but with paint.

        1. **Superhero-Level Crew Availability**: During peak season, our crews
        are busy working their magic across town. But off-season? They're ready
        and raring to go. Think of it like ordering at a restaurant when no one
        else is there—better service, more attention, and you get to pick the
        best table (or in this case, the best time slot).

        1. **Work Without the Crowd**: Nobody likes dodging traffic cones to get
        into their favorite spot. By scheduling during quieter times, we keep
        your clients and customers happy while giving your property a facelift.
        They’ll come back after the work is done, marveling at the glow-up like
        it’s a new attraction.

        1. **Curb Appeal that Says "We've Got It Together"**: Ever seen a
        business that looked like it was stuck in a 'before' photo? Not you.
        With regular maintenance, you’re in perpetual "after" mode, showing the
        world that you’ve got your act together. Because nothing says "we care"
        like a property that looks freshly painted instead of one that’s,
        well... going for a ‘distressed’ look.


        So let Moorhouse Coating keep your property polished, protected, and
        priced right, with plenty of laughs (and savings) along the way!

      title: Painting Maintenance Annual Planning
      description: >
        A multiyear painting agreement for exterior maintenance is the smart,
        long-game play for properties in mountain areas where the elements are
        anything but predictable. Here’s why having a written maintenance plan
        and a proactive approach makes all the difference:


        1. **Mountain Weather: The Ultimate Wildcard**: In mountain areas,
        you’re up against every possible weather mood swing—snow, rain, intense
        sun, and freezing temps, sometimes all in one week! Without a long-term
        plan, you risk waiting until the damage is done. With a multiyear
        agreement, you’ll keep your property protected year after year, no
        matter what curveballs the forecast throws your way.

        1. **Short Season, Long Checklist**: The painting and staining season in
        the mountains is short-lived—barely long enough to fit in a good
        vacation, let alone essential maintenance for your property. A multiyear
        plan ensures that the maintenance gets done as soon as conditions allow.
        No more scrambling to get on the schedule during the rush; you’ll
        already have your spot saved, year after year.

        1. **Prevents Big Repair Costs Down the Line**: Proactive maintenance
        catches issues like peeling, cracking, or fading before they become
        full-blown disasters. This means you’re not just keeping the property
        looking great; you’re also preventing hefty repair costs that would come
        from letting Mother Nature have her way.

        1. **Preserves Curb Appeal and Property Value**: A consistent
        maintenance plan helps keep your property in prime shape. Fading or
        peeling exteriors can make a property look rundown fast, especially in
        harsh weather. But with scheduled care, your property stays looking
        sharp and attractive, preserving its value and appeal.

        1. **A Written Plan for Peace of Mind**: When life gets busy, a written
        maintenance plan keeps everything on track. It’s like setting up a
        calendar reminder for your property’s upkeep. Plus, you and your
        contractor will be on the same page about timelines, areas of focus, and
        any special requirements. No guessing, no last-minute calls—just a
        clear, agreed-upon approach.

        1. **Allows for a Thoughtful, Phased Approach**: With a multiyear
        agreement, we can break down the work into manageable, budget-friendly
        phases. One year, we might focus on high-exposure areas; the next, touch
        up places that need extra care. This phased approach saves you from a
        major expense all at once while keeping your property in great shape.


        Painting agreement in mountain climates isn’t just a luxury—it’s a
        necessity. With a solid, written plan and a proactive approach, you’ll
        have a property that’s ready for whatever the seasons throw at it,
        staying protected and looking pristine year after year.

      title: High Performance Clear Coatings
      description: >
        High-performance clear coatings are a game-changer for surfaces that
        usually require frequent upkeep. Here’s why investing in them makes
        maintenance so much easier—and cost-effective:


        **Long-Lasting Protection**: High-performance clear coatings create a
        durable shield against moisture, UV rays, dirt, and even chemicals, so
        surfaces stay cleaner and protected for longer. This means less wear and
        tear, less fading, and a much tougher resistance to scuffs, scratches,
        and general abuse.


        **Reduced Maintenance Frequency**: Surfaces treated with clear coatings
        require fewer maintenance cycles because they stay in better shape
        between touch-ups. Fewer cycles mean less downtime, lower labor costs,
        and more time spent enjoying a pristine property rather than constantly
        maintaining it.


        **Enhanced Surface Aesthetic**: Clear coatings offer a polished,
        professional look, enhancing the natural color and finish of the
        underlying material. This isn’t just about looks; it’s about putting
        your best foot forward with a clean, well-maintained appearance that
        leaves a great impression on clients and visitors.


        **Resistance to Environmental Stressors**: For areas exposed to
        high-traffic, moisture, and extreme temperatures, high-performance clear
        coatings add an extra layer of resilience. This is especially valuable
        for mountain or coastal environments, where surfaces are constantly
        facing harsh elements that can cause quick degradation without adequate
        protection.


        **Cost-Effective Over Time**: Although clear coatings might have a
        higher upfront cost, the long-term savings are substantial. With less
        frequent maintenance, fewer repairs, and longer-lasting surfaces, these
        coatings provide excellent ROI, stretching your budget further.


        **Improved Cleanability**: Clear coatings make routine cleaning a
        breeze. Because the surface is more resistant to grime, stains, and
        contaminants, cleaning is quicker and requires fewer harsh chemicals,
        saving time and promoting a safer, greener maintenance routine.


        High-performance clear coatings extend the life, look, and cleanliness
        of surfaces that would otherwise need constant attention. It’s a smart
        investment for reducing maintenance costs, keeping appearances sharp,
        and ensuring your surfaces can handle whatever comes their way.

            The cost to paint an average to oversized office (12x14) is
            approximately $240 to $375. Typically the ceiling doesn’t require
            painting so the wall dimensions given a 9.5 foot tall ceiling is

            $2.00 and 3.00 per square foot if the house has been previously
            painted.  A new home will cost between $3.00 and $6.00 per square

            linear feet * 16 = 2240 Square feet.  The average cost per square
            foot is roughly $1.50 to $3.00 a square foot.  So, 2240 sq ft *
            $2.25 is roughly $5,000.00 to paint an existing home exterior.
