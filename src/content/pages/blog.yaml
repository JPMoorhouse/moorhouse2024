        Keeping up with a maintenance painting schedule with Moorhouse Coating
        is like giving your property a mini makeover all year round—with none of
        the reality show drama but all the "wow" factor. Here's why it's a
        no-brainer:


        1. **Make It Last, Like Fine Wine (or Fine Vinyl)**: Regular painting is
        like SPF for your building! It protects those surfaces from the everyday
        wear and tear, rain, sun, and whatever else Mother Nature decides to
        throw at us. Skip the maintenance, and suddenly you’re hosting a peeling
        paint party—but trust us, no one wants to attend that.

        1. **Stealthy Savings During Off-Season**: You know that satisfaction of
        snagging an item on sale? That's what our off-season rates feel like! By
        scheduling during our less busy months, you’re saving those precious
        pennies without cutting corners. It’s like finding a secret stash of
        cash in your winter coat… but with paint.

        1. **Superhero-Level Crew Availability**: During peak season, our crews
        are busy working their magic across town. But off-season? They're ready
        and raring to go. Think of it like ordering at a restaurant when no one
        else is there—better service, more attention, and you get to pick the
        best table (or in this case, the best time slot).

        1. **Work Without the Crowd**: Nobody likes dodging traffic cones to get
        into their favorite spot. By scheduling during quieter times, we keep
        your clients and customers happy while giving your property a facelift.
        They’ll come back after the work is done, marveling at the glow-up like
        it’s a new attraction.

        1. **Curb Appeal that Says "We've Got It Together"**: Ever seen a
        business that looked like it was stuck in a 'before' photo? Not you.
        With regular maintenance, you’re in perpetual "after" mode, showing the
        world that you’ve got your act together. Because nothing says "we care"
        like a property that looks freshly painted instead of one that’s,
        well... going for a ‘distressed’ look.


        So let Moorhouse Coating keep your property polished, protected, and
        priced right, with plenty of laughs (and savings) along the way!

      pretitle: Multiyear Annual Maintenance Painting
      title: 'Painting Maintenance '
      description: >
        A multiyear painting agreement for exterior maintenance is the smart,
        long-game play for properties in mountain areas where the elements are
        anything but predictable. Here’s why having a written maintenance plan
        and a proactive approach makes all the difference:


        1. **Mountain Weather: The Ultimate Wildcard**: In mountain areas,
        you’re up against every possible weather mood swing—snow, rain, intense
        sun, and freezing temps, sometimes all in one week! Without a long-term
        plan, you risk waiting until the damage is done. With a multiyear
        agreement, you’ll keep your property protected year after year, no
        matter what curveballs the forecast throws your way.

        1. **Short Season, Long Checklist**: The painting and staining season in
        the mountains is short-lived—barely long enough to fit in a good
        vacation, let alone essential maintenance for your property. A multiyear
        plan ensures that the maintenance gets done as soon as conditions allow.
        No more scrambling to get on the schedule during the rush; you’ll
        already have your spot saved, year after year.

        1. **Prevents Big Repair Costs Down the Line**: Proactive maintenance
        catches issues like peeling, cracking, or fading before they become
        full-blown disasters. This means you’re not just keeping the property
        looking great; you’re also preventing hefty repair costs that would come
        from letting Mother Nature have her way.

        1. **Preserves Curb Appeal and Property Value**: A consistent
        maintenance plan helps keep your property in prime shape. Fading or
        peeling exteriors can make a property look rundown fast, especially in
        harsh weather. But with scheduled care, your property stays looking
        sharp and attractive, preserving its value and appeal.

        1. **A Written Plan for Peace of Mind**: When life gets busy, a written
        maintenance plan keeps everything on track. It’s like setting up a
        calendar reminder for your property’s upkeep. Plus, you and your
        contractor will be on the same page about timelines, areas of focus, and
        any special requirements. No guessing, no last-minute calls—just a
        clear, agreed-upon approach.

        1. **Allows for a Thoughtful, Phased Approach**: With a multiyear
        agreement, we can break down the work into manageable, budget-friendly
        phases. One year, we might focus on high-exposure areas; the next, touch
        up places that need extra care. This phased approach saves you from a
        major expense all at once while keeping your property in great shape.


        Painting agreement in mountain climates isn’t just a luxury—it’s a
        necessity. With a solid, written plan and a proactive approach, you’ll
        have a property that’s ready for whatever the seasons throw at it,
        staying protected and looking pristine year after year.

      pretitle: Benefits of High Performance Clear Coats
      title: High Performance Clear Coatings
      description: >
        High-performance clear coatings are a game-changer for surfaces that
        usually require frequent upkeep. Here’s why investing in them makes
        maintenance so much easier—and cost-effective:


        **Long-Lasting Protection**: High-performance clear coatings create a
        durable shield against moisture, UV rays, dirt, and even chemicals, so
        surfaces stay cleaner and protected for longer. This means less wear and
        tear, less fading, and a much tougher resistance to scuffs, scratches,
        and general abuse.


        **Reduced Maintenance Frequency**: Surfaces treated with clear coatings
        require fewer maintenance cycles because they stay in better shape
        between touch-ups. Fewer cycles mean less downtime, lower labor costs,
        and more time spent enjoying a pristine property rather than constantly
        maintaining it.


        **Enhanced Surface Aesthetic**: Clear coatings offer a polished,
        professional look, enhancing the natural color and finish of the
        underlying material. This isn’t just about looks; it’s about putting
        your best foot forward with a clean, well-maintained appearance that
        leaves a great impression on clients and visitors.


        **Resistance to Environmental Stressors**: For areas exposed to
        high-traffic, moisture, and extreme temperatures, high-performance clear
        coatings add an extra layer of resilience. This is especially valuable
        for mountain or coastal environments, where surfaces are constantly
        facing harsh elements that can cause quick degradation without adequate
        protection.


        **Cost-Effective Over Time**: Although clear coatings might have a
        higher upfront cost, the long-term savings are substantial. With less
        frequent maintenance, fewer repairs, and longer-lasting surfaces, these
        coatings provide excellent ROI, stretching your budget further.


        **Improved Cleanability**: Clear coatings make routine cleaning a
        breeze. Because the surface is more resistant to grime, stains, and
        contaminants, cleaning is quicker and requires fewer harsh chemicals,
        saving time and promoting a safer, greener maintenance routine.


        High-performance clear coatings extend the life, look, and cleanliness
        of surfaces that would otherwise need constant attention. It’s a smart
        investment for reducing maintenance costs, keeping appearances sharp,
        and ensuring your surfaces can handle whatever comes their way.

            Painters' price range for labor cost varies widely!  Depending on
            the season, location, height, skill and overall experience
            necessary, affect the hourly rate.  Low skilled paint projects will
            sell for $40.00 per hour upto highly experienced professionally
            trained $90.00 per hour.  Average rates hover around $50.00 per hour
            in most cities.

            The average cost to paint the interior of a house falls between
            $2.00 and 3.00 per square foot if the house has been previously
            painted.  A new home will cost between $3.00 and $6.00 per square
            feet depending on the preparation required.  A new custom home cost
            between $6.00 and $12.00 per square feet.

        industry-specific terms:


        ### A


        - **Acrylic Paint**: Water-based paint made with acrylic resin. Known
        for its durability, quick drying time, and versatility for interior and
        exterior surfaces.

        - **Additive**: Substances added to paint to modify its properties, such
        as thickeners, stabilizers, or agents to improve flow and drying time.

        - **ABRASION RESISTANCE**: A specially formulated coating property that
        protect structures against corrosion, damage and wear brought about by
        heat and moisture.\
          \
          **ABRASIVE**: Used for wearing away a surface by rubbing, scraping and sanding in preparation for coating; examples include sandpaper and steel wool.\
          \
          **ACRYLIC**: A synthetic resin used in high-performance, water-based coatings.\
          \
          **ADHESION**: The ability of a coating to stick to a surface.\
          \
          **AIR DRY**: One method by which liquid coatings dry; after solvent evaporation, the binders react with oxygen, or oxidize, creating a hard film.\
          \
          **AIRLESS SPRAY**: Applicator that pumps coating at a very high pressure through a hose with a tip designed to spray paint evenly in a fan-shaped pattern, covering more area quickly.\
          \
          **ALKALI**: A substance such as lye, soda or lime that can be highly caustic or corrosive to paint films.\
          \
          **ALKYD**: Any of a group of synthetic resins that are used in varnishes, paints and adhesives; a paint in which the vehicle is an alkyd resin.\
          \
          **ALLIGATORING**: A paint failure that appears like small cracks resembling alligator skin due to too many coats, a topcoat applied before the basecoat fully dried or temperature changes that cause substrates to expand and contract.\
          \
          **ANTI-CORROSIVE PAINT**: Designed to inhibit abrasion and rust and applied directly to that’s used on iron, steel and other metallic substrates, often used as a primer for finish coats.

        ### B


        - **Back Rolling**: A technique where paint is rolled over a freshly
        sprayed area to ensure even coverage and adhesion, often used for porous
        surfaces.

        - **Binder**: The component in paint that holds pigments together and
        provides adhesion to the surface. Common binders include acrylic, latex,
        and oil.

        - **Blistering**: Bubbles or raised areas that form on the paint
        surface, usually due to moisture, heat, or poor surface preparation.

        - **Bleeding**: When a substance (e.g., tannins from wood) seeps through
        paint, causing discoloration. Primers help prevent this.

        - **BARRIER COAT**: A layer of a primer or coating that obstructs or
        prevents the passage of water or other contaminants through a surface.
        See Intermediate Coat.\
          \
          **BINDER**: The component of paint that joins pigment particles together to form the film and can determine many of the coating’s performance properties — washability, durability, adhesion, color retention, etc.\
          \
          **BLEACHING**: The process of lightening or restoring discolored or stained wood to its normal color.\
          \
          **BLEEDING**: Describes an undercoat staining through the topcoat. Soluble dyes or pigments in undercoat are dissolved by solvents in topcoat and stain through to the new finish.\
          \
          **BLISTERING**: The formation of bubbles or pimples on a painted surface caused by moisture in a topcoat before the previous coating one thoroughly dried or excessive heat. Also called bubbling.\
          \
          **BLUSHING**: A coating that becomes cloudy or dull through moisture or excessive solvent evaporation.\
          \
          **BODY**: The consistency of a coating. See Viscosity.\
          \
          **BOXING**: Mixing paint by pouring from one container to another several times to ensure a consistent, well-blended color.\
          \
          **BREATHE**: The ability of a paint film to permit moisture permeation without causing failure.\
          \
          **BRIDGING**: The ability of a paint to cover or stretch over cracks, voids or other small gaps.\
          \
          **BRISTLES**: The working part of a brush that contains natural (usually hog) or artificial (nylon or polyester) stiff hairs.\
          \
          **BRUSHABILITY**: The ability or ease with which paint can be brushed onto a surface.\
          \
          **BRUSH-OUT**: A technique that consists of applying a sample of paint to a piece of wood or other material, illustrating the finished surface.\
          \

        surface due to weathering, commonly seen in older exterior paints.

        - **Cutting In**: The technique of painting edges and corners with a
        brush before using a roller for larger areas, creating clean, precise
        edges.

        over furniture or floors to catch drips and spills.

        - **Dry Brushing**: A technique where a nearly dry brush is used to
        lightly apply paint, often creating a textured or aged effect.


        ### E


        - **Eggshell Finish**: A paint finish with a low luster, slightly
        shinier than flat but less than satin. Often used for walls and trim due
        to its subtle sheen and durability.

        - **Enamel**: A paint that dries to a hard, glossy finish. Typically
        used on surfaces that require durability, like doors and cabinets.


        ### F


        - **Feathering**: Gradually thinning the edges of paint to blend with
        surrounding areas, especially useful for touch-ups.

        - **Flat Finish**: Paint with a non-reflective finish, ideal for hiding
        imperfections on walls but less washable than other finishes.


        ### G


        - **Grain Raising**: The roughening of wood fibers that can occur when
        water-based finishes are applied, requiring sanding between coats.


        ### H


        - **HVLP (High Volume Low Pressure)**: A type of spray system that
