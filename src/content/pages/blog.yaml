            approximately $240 to $375. Typically the ceiling doesn’t require
            painting so the wall dimensions given a 9.5 foot tall ceiling is
            12+12+14+14=52 * 9.5= 494 Square Feet.  $0.75 = Total $ 370.50.

            Painters' price range for labor cost varies widely!  Depending on
            the season, location, height, skill and overall experience
            necessary, affect the hourly rate.  Low skilled paint projects will
            sell for $40.00 per hour upto highly experienced professionally
            trained $90.00 per hour.  Average rates hover around $50.00 per hour
            in most cities.

            The average cost to paint the interior of a house falls between
            $2.00 and 3.00 per square foot if the house has been previously
            painted.  A new home will cost between $3.00 and $6.00 per square
            feet depending on the preparation required.  A new custom home cost
            between $6.00 and $12.00 per square feet.

            The average cost to paint the outside of a 2200 square foot house is
            $5000.00 If the perimeter is 30 x 40, roughly  30+30+40+40 = 140
            linear feet * 16 = 2240 Square feet.  The average cost per square
            foot is roughly $1.50 to $3.00 a square foot.  So, 2240 sq ft *
            $2.25 is roughly $5,000.00 to paint an existing home exterior.

            prices.  Check with your local Sherwin Williams, PPG, Dunn Edwards
            or Benjamin Moore retail paint center.

        Keeping up with a maintenance painting schedule with Moorhouse Coating
        is like giving your property a mini makeover all year round—with none of
        the reality show drama but all the "wow" factor. Here's why it's a
        no-brainer:


        1. **Make It Last, Like Fine Wine (or Fine Vinyl)**: Regular painting is
        like SPF for your building! It protects those surfaces from the everyday
        wear and tear, rain, sun, and whatever else Mother Nature decides to
        throw at us. Skip the maintenance, and suddenly you’re hosting a peeling
        paint party—but trust us, no one wants to attend that.

        1. **Stealthy Savings During Off-Season**: You know that satisfaction of
        snagging an item on sale? That's what our off-season rates feel like! By
        scheduling during our less busy months, you’re saving those precious
        pennies without cutting corners. It’s like finding a secret stash of
        cash in your winter coat… but with paint.

        1. **Superhero-Level Crew Availability**: During peak season, our crews
        are busy working their magic across town. But off-season? They're ready
        and raring to go. Think of it like ordering at a restaurant when no one
        else is there—better service, more attention, and you get to pick the
        best table (or in this case, the best time slot).

        1. **Work Without the Crowd**: Nobody likes dodging traffic cones to get
        into their favorite spot. By scheduling during quieter times, we keep
        your clients and customers happy while giving your property a facelift.
        They’ll come back after the work is done, marveling at the glow-up like
        it’s a new attraction.

        1. **Curb Appeal that Says "We've Got It Together"**: Ever seen a
        business that looked like it was stuck in a 'before' photo? Not you.
        With regular maintenance, you’re in perpetual "after" mode, showing the
        world that you’ve got your act together. Because nothing says "we care"
        like a property that looks freshly painted instead of one that’s,
        well... going for a ‘distressed’ look.


        So let Moorhouse Coating keep your property polished, protected, and
        priced right, with plenty of laughs (and savings) along the way!
