            Painting the exterior of your house is about more than just curb
            appeal. The right paint provides a protective layer between your
            home and the elements, preventing costly damage to siding, trim and
            other materials. With proper prep work and the right paint for the
            job, you can expect your home’s paint job to look great and stand up
            to the conditions for several years.

            There are several important factors to consider when planning and
            completing an industrial painting project. These factors include
            substrate material, chemical exposure, atmospheric conditions, and
            required lifespan of the new coating system. Working with an
            experienced industrial painting contractor with many years of
            experience can be the difference in the success of a project.

            Moorhouse Coating painted several areas of our shopping mall,
            including common areas and exterior facades. Their team was
            professional and efficient, ensuring minimal disruption to shoppers
            and tenants. The mall looks fantastic, and the paint job has really
            enhanced the overall appearance of the property. We highly recommend
            them for any large-scale commercial project.
