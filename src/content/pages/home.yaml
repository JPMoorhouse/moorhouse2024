            Painting the exterior of your house is about more than just curb
            appeal. The right paint provides a protective layer between your
            home and the elements, preventing costly damage to siding, trim and
            other materials. With proper prep work and the right paint for the
            job, you can expect your home’s paint job to look great and stand up
            to the conditions for several years.
