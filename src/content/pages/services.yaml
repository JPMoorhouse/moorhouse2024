          description: >-
            Painting the exterior of your house is about more than just curb
            appeal. The right paint provides a protective layer between your
            home and the elements, preventing costly damage to siding, trim and
            other materials. With proper prep work and the right paint for the
            job, you can expect your home’s paint job to look great and stand up
            to the conditions for several years.

            There are several important factors to consider when planning and
            completing an industrial painting project. These factors include
            substrate material, chemical exposure, atmospheric conditions, and
            required lifespan of the new coating system. Working with an
            experienced industrial painting contractor with many years of
            experience can be the difference in the success of a project.

            "I recently hired Moorhouse Coating for a pressure washing job at my
            commercial property, and I couldn't be happier with the results.
            Their team arrived on time, and the level of professionalism was
            impressive. They thoroughly cleaned our building's exterior,
            removing years of grime and buildup that had dulled its appearance.
            The difference is night and day!

            The crew was courteous and made sure to protect surrounding areas
            from any potential damage. The job was completed efficiently, and
            the area was left spotless. I highly recommend Moorhouse Coating for
            anyone in need of top-quality pressure washing services!

            "Moorhouse Coating did a great job pressure washing the sidewalks
            and parking lot at our office complex. The results were impressive,
            with all the stains and debris removed. The team was professional
            and worked quickly, though there was a slight delay in scheduling
            which was understandable given the busy season. Overall, we're very
            satisfied with the service and would use them again for future
            cleaning projects."

            "Just had Moorhouse Coating handle a major pressure washing job for
            our retail space, and they did an outstanding job. The difference in
            cleanliness was remarkable, with our storefront and outdoor areas
            looking brand new. The technicians were friendly, efficient, and
            careful not to damage any landscaping or fixtures. They also gave us
            some tips on how to maintain the cleanliness moving forward.
            Excellent service and great value!"
