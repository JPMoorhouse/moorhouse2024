            Moorhouse Coating is an amazing company. Their interior finishes are
            amazing and the crews they have for painting are professional,
            clean, and very knowledgeable. I would recommend Moorhouse Coating

            We chose Moorhouse Coating to paint the exterior of our home, and we
            couldn’t be more pleased. The team was efficient, respectful, and
            paid attention to every detail. The finished product is stunning,
            and it’s clear that they take pride in their work. Highly recommend
            them for any exterior painting needs.
