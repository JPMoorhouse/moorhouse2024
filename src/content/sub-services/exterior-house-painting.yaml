      title: Exterior House Painting
      description: >
        Exterior home painting is physically challenging. Prep work can often be
        under appreciated. A quality job begins with having a good surface to
        work with. Prep work requires patience and expertise that tends to get
        glossed over by non-professionals.&nbsp; Proper preparation will entail
        pressure washing, sanding, caulking, patching and removing chips, peels,
        mold, mildew, lead paint, and all other imperfections. Proper
        prep&nbsp;and priming will enhance surface consistency for paint
        adhesion and long lasting quality results. \

        \

        Prior to applying any paint, patio furniture, potted plants and any
        other surfaces that are not being painted must be removed and/or
        covered. A product will be chosen after the color scheme has been
        decided. Depending upon your substrate, different products will give you
        different results for color. Moorhouse Coating has professional color
        consultants who can assist you with choosing the right color
        combinations for your home. Our exterior home painters will then use
        high-quality material to make a project as vibrant and long-lasting as
        possible.
